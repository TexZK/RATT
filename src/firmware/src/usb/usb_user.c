 * the official USB specifications) requests, while
 * others may be specific to the USB device class
 * that is being implemented. For example, a HID
 * class device needs to be able to respond to
 * "GET REPORT" type of requests. This
 * is not a standard USB chapter 9 request, and

/**
 * The USB specifications allow some types of USB
 * peripheral devices to wake up a host PC (such
 * as if it is in a low power suspend to RAM state).
 * This can be a very useful feature in some
 * USB applications, such as an Infrared remote
 * control	receiver. If a user presses the "power"
 * button on a remote control, it is nice that the
 * IR receiver can detect this signalling, and then
 * send a USB "command" to the PC to wake up.
 * 
 * The USBCBSendResume() "callback" function is used
 * to send this special USB signalling which wakes 
 * up the PC. This function may be called by
 * application firmware to wake up the PC. This
 * function will only be able to wake up the host if
 * all of the below are true:
 *	
 * 1. The USB driver used on the host PC supports
 *    the remote wakeup capability.
 * 2. The USB configuration descriptor indicates
 *    the device is remote wakeup capable in the
 *    bmAttributes field.
 * 3. The USB host PC is currently sleeping,
 *    and has previously sent your device a SET 
 *    FEATURE setup packet which "armed" the
 *    remote wakeup capability.  
 *
 * If the host has not armed the device to perform remote wakeup,
 * then this function will return without actually performing a
 * remote wakeup sequence. This is the required behavior, 
 * as a USB device that has not been armed to perform remote 
 * wakeup must not drive remote wakeup signalling onto the bus;
 * doing so will cause USB compliance testing failure.
 * 
 * This callback should send a RESUME signal that
 * has the period of 1-15ms.
 * 
 * Note: This function does nothing and returns quickly, if the USB
 * bus and host are not in a suspended condition, or are 
 * otherwise not in a remote wakeup ready state. Therefore, it
 * is safe to optionally call this function regularly, ex: 
 * anytime application stimulus occurs, as the function will
 * have no effect, until the bus really is in a state ready
 * to accept remote wakeup. 
 * 
 * When this function executes, it may perform clock switching,
 * depending upon the application specific code in 
 * USBCBWakeFromSuspend(). This is needed, since the USB
 * bus will no longer be suspended by the time this function
 * returns. Therefore, the USB module will need to be ready
 * to receive traffic from the host.
 * 
 * The modifiable section in this routine may be changed
 * to meet the application needs. Current implementation
 * temporary blocks other functions from executing for a
 * period of ~3-15 ms depending on the core frequency.
 * 
 * According to USB 2.0 specification section 7.1.7.7,
 * "The remote wakeup device must hold the resume signaling
 * for at least 1 ms but for no more than 15 ms."
 * The idea here is to use a delay counter loop, using a
 * common value that would work over a wide range of core
 * frequencies.
 * That value selected is 1800. See table below:
 * ==========================================================
 * Core Freq(MHz)      MIP         RESUME Signal Period (ms)
 * ==========================================================
 *     48              12          1.05
 *      4              1           12.6
 * ==========================================================
 * * These timing could be incorrect when using code
 * optimization or extended instruction mode,
 * or when having other interrupts enabled.
 * Make sure to verify using the MPLAB SIM's Stopwatch
 * and verify the actual signal on an oscilloscope.

/*
 * The USB firmware stack will call the callback functions USBCBxxx() in response to certain USB related
 * events. For example, if the host PC is powering down, it will stop sending out Start of Frame (SOF)
 * packets to your device. In response to this, all USB devices are supposed to decrease their power
 * consumption from the USB Vbus to <2.5mA each. The USB module detects this condition (which according
 * to the USB specifications is 3+ms of no bus activity/SOF packets) and then calls the USBCBSuspend()
 * function. You should modify these callback functions to take appropriate actions for each of these
 * conditions. For example, in the USBCBSuspend(), you may wish to add code that will decrease power
 * consumption from Vbus to <2.5mA (such as by clock switching, turning off LEDs, putting the
 * microcontroller to sleep, etc.). Then, in the USBCBWakeFromSuspend() function, you may then wish to
 * add code that undoes the power saving things done in the USBCBSuspend() function.
 * 
 * The USBCBSendResume() function is special, in that the USB stack will not automatically call this
 * function. This function is meant to be called from the application firmware instead. See the
 * additional comments near the function.

	 * ConfigureIOPinsForLowPower();
	 * SaveStateOfAllInterruptEnableBits();
	 * DisableAllInterruptEnableBits();
	 * EnableOnlyTheInterruptsWhichWillBeUsedToWakeTheMicro();	//should enable at least USBActivityIF as a wake source

	 * IMPORTANT NOTE: Do not clear the USBActivityIF (ACTVIF) bit here. This bit is

	 * fully back to normal, and capable of receiving and processing USB

	 * packet to your device, but the packet gets corrupted (ex:
	 * because of a bad connection, or the user unplugs the
	 * USB cable during the transmission) this will typically set
	 * one or more USB error interrupt flags. Nothing specific
	 * needs to be done however, since the SIE will automatically
	 * send a "NAK" packet to the host. In response to this, the

	 * data loss occurs. The system will typically recover
	 * automatically, without the need for application firmware
